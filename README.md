# Password Generator

Passwords are everywhere these days: email accounts, bank accounts, social media accounts&nbsp;&mdash; the list goes on! Having strong passwords across all of these platforms will keep your information safe from bad actors that want to use your private information for nefarious purposes like identity theft or financial fraud.

Hereâ€™s the simple equation. Longer passwords are safer.

If the password is too short, it can be susceptible to a brute force attack, where a computer, or malicious computer program, goes through every combination of characters. The program may also go through the most common passwords, guessing in a handful of tries.

Experts agree that length is a critical element of password strength. In fact, the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) states,

> _Password length has been found to be a primary factor in characterizing password strength._

At just 16 characters, random strings are extremely secure.

It is much harder for a computer to guess them, and would likely take centuries.

Users' online world revolves around logins and passwords. To stay safe from data breaches, you need to create strong and unique passwords for every account.

The Password Generator is a tool designed to help you. The generated passwords meet high security standards and can be customized to suit individual needs. With the Password Generator, you can easily create unique and strong passwords to enhance your online security.
